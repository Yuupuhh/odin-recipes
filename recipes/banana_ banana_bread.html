    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Most popular banana bread is moist, delicious, and absolutely packed with banana flavor.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
      <li><strong>Baking soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.</li>
      <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.</li>
      <li><strong>Butter</strong>: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.</li>
      <li><strong>Brown sugar</strong>: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.</li>
      <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
      <li><strong>Bananas</strong>: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
    </ul>
